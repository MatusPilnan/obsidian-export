Don't escape square brackets in math expressions

The upgrade to [pulldown-cmark](https://crates.io/crates/pulldown-cmark) 0.11 (see Backwards-incompatible Changes) includes official support for LaTeX-style math expressions.
With the markdown parser supporting this syntax natively, math expressions are now processed correctly without edge-cases.
